So I was walking down the street and I saw a leprechaun. He seemed like a friendly fellow so I smiled at him and went about my way. 
Then I came across another leprechaun.  I smiled at him as well.
After walking past several leprechauns, I got curious.  
Where are all these leprechauns coming from?

Apparently there was a nuclear rainbow!
